## Overview

WarehouseWreckage is an exciting course project developed for the Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games." The project focuses on implementing various gameplay mechanics and level design elements using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++ programming. By exploring fundamental concepts in game development, WarehouseWreckage aims to provide an interactive and educational experience for aspiring game developers.

## Features

1. **Playing with Physics:** In WarehouseWreckage, players can experience a physics-driven environment that adds a sense of realism and interactivity. The project utilizes UE5's powerful physics engine to create dynamic interactions between objects within the warehouse.

2. **Spawning Projectiles:** Players have the ability to spawn and launch projectiles within the warehouse. By implementing projectile spawning mechanisms in C++, the game mechanics allow for a range of interactions and creative possibilities.

3. **Aiming the Projectiles:** Precise aiming is crucial for successful gameplay in WarehouseWreckage. Through C++ programming, players must master the art of aiming to hit targets accurately, adding a skill-based element to the game.

4. **Building a Level:** The project includes a custom level created within UE5. The level design showcases the potential of the engine and serves as an excellent example for understanding level design principles and workflows.

5. **Limiting Ammo:** To add an element of challenge and resource management, WarehouseWreckage incorporates limited ammunition for the player's projectiles. This feature encourages players to strategize and make every shot count.

6. **Reloading Levels:** WarehouseWreckage introduces the concept of reloading levels, allowing players to reset the warehouse and start fresh. This feature provides an opportunity for players to refine their skills and experiment with different gameplay approaches.
